Description: This package has implementation for Euclidean and Dijkstra algorithms. 
    The function euclidean finds greatest common divisor for two numbers.Takes two numbers scalars or integers as arguments and return their greatest common divisor.
    The function dijkstra takes a graph and an initial node and calculates the shortest path from the initial node to every other node in the graph. It takes data.frame and numeric scalar as arguments and returns vector.
